# 🌍 Air Insight

**Air Insight** is a modern, data-driven web application built with TypeScript, React, and TailwindCSS. It empowers users to visualize, compare, and analyze air quality across global cities, understand health impacts, and explore actionable insights tied to environmental data and the UN's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
